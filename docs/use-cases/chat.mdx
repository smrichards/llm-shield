description: Mask PII when pasting into ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini
---

Paste customer data into ChatGPT — the AI sees `[[PERSON_1]]` and `[[EMAIL_ADDRESS_1]]`. When you copy the response, placeholders are replaced with the originals.

## Supported Platforms

- ChatGPT (chatgpt.com)
- Claude (claude.ai)
- Google Gemini (gemini.google.com)

## How It Works

1. **Paste** — You paste text containing PII into the chat input
2. **Mask** — The extension detects and masks PII via your local PasteGuard server
3. **Chat** — The masked text is inserted into the chat. The AI only sees placeholders.
4. **Copy** — When you copy the AI's response, placeholders are replaced with the original values

Placeholder numbering stays consistent across messages in the same conversation. Streamed responses are highlighted in real-time.

## Requirements

The extension needs PasteGuard running locally:

```bash
docker run --rm -p 3000:3000 ghcr.io/sgasser/pasteguard:en
```

See [Quickstart](/quickstart) for setup details.

## Beta

The browser extension is in beta. Open source (Apache 2.0).
