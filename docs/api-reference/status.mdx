# Status Endpoints

## Health Check

Check if PasteGuard and its dependencies are running.

```
GET /health
```

### Request

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Response

Returns HTTP 200 when healthy, HTTP 503 when degraded.

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "services": {
    "presidio": "up"
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

When a service is down:

```json
{
  "status": "degraded",
  "services": {
    "presidio": "down"
  },
  "timestamp": "2026-01-15T10:30:00Z"
}
```

In route mode, `local_llm` is also included in services.

## Info

Get current configuration and mode.

```
GET /info
```

### Request

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/info
```

### Response

```json
{
  "name": "PasteGuard",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Privacy proxy for LLMs",
  "mode": "mask",
  "providers": {
    "openai": {
      "base_url": "https://api.openai.com/v1"
    }
  },
  "pii_detection": {
    "languages": ["en"],
    "fallback_language": "en",
    "score_threshold": 0.7,
    "entities": ["PERSON", "EMAIL_ADDRESS", "PHONE_NUMBER"]
  },
  "masking": {
    "show_markers": false
  }
}
```

When language validation is available, `languages` becomes an object:

```json
{
  "pii_detection": {
    "languages": {
      "configured": ["en", "de", "fr"],
      "available": ["en", "de"],
      "missing": ["fr"]
    }
  }
}
```

In route mode, `local` provider info is also included.
