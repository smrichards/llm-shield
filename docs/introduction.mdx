# What is PasteGuard?

PasteGuard is an OpenAI-compatible proxy that protects personal data and secrets before sending to your provider (OpenAI, Azure, self-hosted, etc.).

## The Problem

When using LLM APIs, every prompt is sent to external servers - including customer names, emails, and sensitive business data. Many organizations have policies against sending PII to third-party AI services.

## The Solution

PasteGuard sits between your app and the LLM API:

Two privacy modes:

| Mode | How it works |
|------|--------------|
| **Mask** | Replace PII with placeholders, send to provider, restore in response |
| **Route** | PII requests stay on your local LLM (Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp), others go to your configured provider |

## Quick Example

<Steps>
  <Step title="You send a prompt">
    ```
    Write a follow-up email to Dr. Sarah Chen (sarah.chen@hospital.org)
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="PasteGuard masks PII">
    Detected: `Dr. Sarah Chen` → `[[PERSON_1]]`, `sarah.chen@hospital.org` → `[[EMAIL_ADDRESS_1]]`
  </Step>
  <Step title="OpenAI receives">
    ```
    Write a follow-up email to [[PERSON_1]] ([[EMAIL_ADDRESS_1]])
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="You get the response (unmasked)">
    ```
    Dear Dr. Sarah Chen, Following up on our discussion...
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>The LLM never sees the real data. PII is masked before sending and restored in the response.</Note>
