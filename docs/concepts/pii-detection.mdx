## Language Support

PasteGuard supports 24 languages. The language is auto-detected from your input text.

**Available languages:** Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Ukrainian

### Docker Images

Languages are auto-configured per image — no config changes needed:

- **`:en` image** → English only
- **`:eu` image** → English, German, Spanish, French, Italian, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian

For custom languages, build locally:

```bash
LANGUAGES=en,de,ja docker compose up -d --build
```

If only one language is configured, language detection is skipped for better performance.

## Confidence Scoring

Each detected entity has a confidence score (0.0 - 1.0). The default threshold is 0.7.

- **Higher threshold** = fewer false positives, might miss some PII
- **Lower threshold** = catches more PII, more false positives

```yaml
pii_detection:
  score_threshold: 0.7
```

## Response Headers

When PII is detected:

```
X-PasteGuard-PII-Detected: true
X-PasteGuard-PII-Masked: true   # mask mode only
X-PasteGuard-Language: en
```

If the fallback language was used:

```
X-PasteGuard-Language-Fallback: true
```
