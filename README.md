  <em>Your App → PasteGuard → OpenAI — PII never reaches external servers</em>
</p>

<br/>

## What is PasteGuard?

When you use LLM APIs, every prompt is sent to external servers — including customer names, emails, and sensitive business data. Many organizations have policies against sending PII to third-party AI services.

PasteGuard is an OpenAI-compatible proxy that sits between your app and the LLM API. It detects personal data and secrets before they leave your network.

**Two ways to protect your data:**

- **Mask Mode** — Replace PII with placeholders, send to your provider, restore in response. No local infrastructure needed.
- **Route Mode** — Send PII requests to a local LLM (Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp), everything else to your provider. Data never leaves your network.

Works with OpenAI, Azure, and any OpenAI-compatible API. Just change one URL.

## Features

- **PII Detection** — Names, emails, phone numbers, credit cards, IBANs, and more
- **Secrets Detection** — API keys, tokens, private keys caught before they reach the LLM
- **Streaming Support** — Real-time unmasking as tokens arrive
- **24 Languages** — Works in English, German, French, and 21 more
- **OpenAI-Compatible** — Change one URL, keep your code
- **Self-Hosted** — Your servers, your data stays yours
- **Open Source** — Apache 2.0 license, full transparency
- **Dashboard** — See every protected request in real-time

## How It Works

```
You send:     "Write a follow-up email to Dr. Sarah Chen (sarah.chen@hospital.org)
               about next week's project meeting"

LLM receives: "Write a follow-up email to [[PERSON_1]] ([[EMAIL_ADDRESS_1]])
               about next week's project meeting"

LLM responds: "Dear [[PERSON_1]], Following up on our discussion..."

You receive:  "Dear Dr. Sarah Chen, Following up on our discussion..."
```

PasteGuard sits between your app and your provider. It's OpenAI-compatible — just change the base URL.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sgasser/pasteguard.git
cd pasteguard
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
docker compose up -d
```

Point your app to `http://localhost:3000/openai/v1` instead of `https://api.openai.com/v1`.

Dashboard: [http://localhost:3000/dashboard](http://localhost:3000/dashboard)
